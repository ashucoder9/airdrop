# Airdrop

This is basically a Questbook project to learn how to perform transactions on Solana blockchain. Very straightforward and fairly simple project. You need to have basic understanding of NodeJS and JavaScript.

Solana runs a replica of its mainnet called as "devnet" where developers can test their applications on the Solana network. This short project basically teaches you to generate your own wallet, fetch its balance, and anonymously airdrop some SOL into your wallet. Hope you too will enjoy learning Solana with Web3.js
